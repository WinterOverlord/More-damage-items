This mod is based on Minecraft Forge 1.20.1 and adds weapons, minerals, and blocks. The most outrageous thing is that there is a villager named SB. The first step is to put an emerald block, and the villager will become a spectrum of stickers., And it also added a record called Apple Fragrance, and added a new dimension with a little Easter egg that I won't mention.
